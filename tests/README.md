## Test Directories
The tests are located in directories with the following acronyms:
- `tests_a`: Contains small random graphs.
- `tests_a_dense`: Contains small dense graphs.
- `tests_t`: Contains trees.

## Test File Format
Each file contains one test case and describes two graphs, one after another. The format of the test file is as follows:
1. Start with the number of nodes and edges for the first graph.
2. List the edges, with one edge per line.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to describe the second graph.
4. There are no separation lines between the graphs.
5. Nodes are numbered starting from 0.

## Test File Decompression
Please note that the test files need to be manually decompressed before use.
