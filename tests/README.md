The tests are located in directories with the following acronyms:
- `tests_a`: Contains small random graphs.
- `tests_a_dense`: Contains small dense graphs.
- `tests_t`: Contains trees.
- `tests_tr0`: Contains tress rooted at 0.

## Test File Format
Each file contains one test case and describes two graphs, one after another. The format of the test file is as follows:
1. Number of nodes and edges for the first graph.
2. List of the edges, with one edge per line.
3. Number of nodes and edges for the second graph.
4. List of the edges, with one edge per line.
5. Nodes are numbered starting from 0.

## Test File Decompression
